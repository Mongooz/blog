summary: It's actually a common question we get, "when are you getting a dog?". I guessed it surprised us too, when it finally happened.

A post online for an Australian Shepherd caught Anita's eye, and we decided to reach out to the breeder. We explained what we were looking for, and what we thought we could offer a new fluffy friend. Shortly, we got a reply that said there was already someone interested, but they might just have the perfect alternative pairing for us. The next weekend, we arranged to come and meet Stampa, a 5-year-old Australian Shepherd from a working line that loves cuddles and playing ball.

We had often talked about getting a dog, but we really weren't expecting to be bringing one home from our first visit to an Australian Shepherd breeder. Once we met Stampa, there was no doubt that he was the dog for us. He was super responsive and attentive, a dream on the lead, and cannot ever get enough cuddles. It makes you think... What's the catch?

Unfortunately, Stampa is not in peak condition for competing in muster trials anymore. He has an issue with his eyesight in one eye, although I don't think you'd be able to tell by watching him. His breeding days were cut short by a potentially genetic condition that the breeders couldn't risk continuing. The main reason they felt that he would be going to a better home was that Stampa is flighty. He gets scared during thunderstorms, or when he hears a gunshot, and just jumps the fence and starts running. He needed a home he could be inside and cared for, and we had just the place!

We made the eager decision to take him home with us, and we didn't want to wait. I don't think he was super thrilled about the car ride, but he did what he was asked without hesitation, and settled in for the hour journey to his new forever home. He took very quickly to the adjustment of being an inside dog, but he wasn't sure about all the current occupants.

We tried to safely introduce him to all the animals, as best we could, but the goats can be particularly defiant, so we played that one extra safe. When not fronting up to animals much bigger than him, and begging for cuddles, Stampa was nuts for a ball.

The previous owner let us bring his favourite ball with us, a bright red, and very hard plastic, that had been the main factor in wearing down Stampa's canines. The red ball game wasn't our favourite, as it was pretty painful to kick that thing around, so we sought out a more tooth-safe alternative.

![It was going to take some work to convince Stampa to leave his ball behind](/static/images/stampa/gotchya.jpg)

We found an old canoe polo ball in the shed, to see if we could transition him off this bowling ball. It took some convincing, but I think Stampa's teeth and my feet are a lot happier for it.

We still have some learning to do on how to handle a working dog, and being safe around Astro, but I think Stampa is doing really well with us. He seems really happy so far, and we certainly are happier for having him around.
