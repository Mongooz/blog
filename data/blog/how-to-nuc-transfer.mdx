Here's how you switch from a Nucleus box to a full frame hive:

* Remove the lid of the Nuc
* Hit it firmly against the ground in front of the hive displace the bees in the lid
* Place the lid at least a couple of metres from the hive
* Move the Nuc box away from the hive, but in reach
* Quickly place the new hive with the opening positioned as close as possible to where the Nuc opening was
* Insert the extra frames (3 frames if going from a 5 frame Nuc to an 8 frame hive) on the outsides
* One by one, carefully take the frames from the Nuc box
* Try to locate the queen as you inspect each frame, as you need to be very careful to protect her from harm as you move her
* Carefully place the frame into the new hive
* Give the empty Nuc box a firm tap on the ground directly in front of the hive entrance to displace any bees
* Place the empty box with the entrance facing the opposite direction away from the hive
* Place a hive beetle trap mat (we used vinyl) on top of the frames
* Gently replace the hive lid and secure it with a cam strap or similar
* When packing up, be sure to check the box and lid for any lost bees and tap them in front of the hive if there are

And in writing it out in that level of detail makes me realise that although it's easy, it's not necessarily simple.
